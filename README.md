## File Explanation
### CatsDogs_recognition.ipynb
This file was created for practicing ResNet18 to distinguish between cats and dogs. With the given dataset, the training dataset was split into an 80:20 ratio. The model's test results are then represented in a confusion matrix at the end of the notebook.

### Number_Recongnition.ipynb
This file was created for practicing CNN to predict hand-written numbers. To train the model, I used number data from the TensorFlow MNIST dataset. After training for 15 epochs, you can check the logits to see the maximum prediction.

### TinyShakespear.ipynb
This file was created to practice using the GPT-2 model to observe how training affects the tone of text outputs. After training for 15 and 30 epochs using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, the model's output changed to a more Shakespearean style.
